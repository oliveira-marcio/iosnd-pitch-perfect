# Pitch Perfect

First project of [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). It's a simple app that plays around with `AVFoundation` where users can record their voices and play with different effects (echo, pitch distortion, reverb, etc.)

## Installation

Clone this repository, import into [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and build it with simulator.
